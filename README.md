# Conway's Game of Life (Java/Swing)
You can read about the game [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).  

This repository is a project submission for a sophomore level university course called GUI Design & Development. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the fundamentals of GUI development using the Java Swing library.


## Installation

The code is uploaded as a Netbeans project. You can go ahead and open it with that IDE to build and run.
Additionally, you can build it without an IDE in any operating system that has the Java Development Kit (JDK), and then run it with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). In your terminal, navigate to the directory that holds all the code. Then type:

```bash
javac *.java
```
Now you should have all the related class files. To run the application, type: 
```bash
java Main
```
